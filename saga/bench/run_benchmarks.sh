echo "Performance Gap Analysis:"
echo "- Rust is significantly faster for encoding operations"
echo "- Training performance shows Rust advantage"
echo "- OCaml needs optimization to compete"

echo "Key metrics to compare:"
echo "- Encoding throughput (MiB/s)"
echo "- Training time for vocabulary building"
echo "- Memory usage patterns"
